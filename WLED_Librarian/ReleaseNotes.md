**8-14-2025** - WledLibrarian v0.3 is updated to process custom palettes that are associated with a 
preset. The palette data is handled as part of import/export. Future librarian features may include 
standalone palette file import/export.<br/>

Palette data is stored in a new Palettes database table. The v0.2 database is not compatible with 
the v0.3 librarian code. If using the v0.2 version, recreate the database or use the v0.3 sample 
database. <br/><br/>

**8-03-2025** - Initial WledLibrarian v0.2 release.
