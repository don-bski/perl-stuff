### Model Railroad
**OS: Linux RPi-3**<br/>
An advanced model railroad control program for automating things like block occupancy detection, track 
signaling, turnout positioning, and reverse loop polarity. Uses forked processes and provides a barebones 
webserver for operational status display. RPi-3 and hardware 'hats' interface the layout sensors, turnout 
servos, and signal indicators. Trackside searchlight semaphore signals utilize a custom build 74HC595 shift 
register hat. Hardware schematics and layout details are included.
