    <p><font face="Arial">This section details the redesign of the D&amp;B model railroad control 
    electronics using the Raspberry Pi (RPi). This
    inexpensive full computer system on a single circuit board is sufficently powerful to 
    handle all of the D&amp;B model railroad functions previously performed by multiple Basic 
    Stamps. Running free and widely available linux based software, the Raspberry Pi is widely 
    supported by companies and web communities like AdaFruit, Sparkfun, The PiHut, and
	 AB electronics UK. These websites showcase what the RPi can do and help to minimize the 
    learning curve. See the Raspberry Pi Wiki Hub.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial">The RPi runs an operating system called raspbian. This linux is a 
    derivative of debian that has been customized for use with the 
    Raspberry Pi hardware. Though requiring a separate install, I found the LXDE GUI to 
    be much better (and prettier) than the default GUI. Search 'Raspberry Pi LXDE GUI'.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial">The code developed for the D&amp;B model railroad is written in perl 
	which has a large body of downloadable support code on the internet. The redesign uses the 
	existing cable connections to the turnouts; though the solenoid switch machines are replaced 
	with R/C servos. Refer to the Basic Stamp pages for an understanding of the construction and 
    control electronics previously developed. Having operated the model railroad for many 
    years, there were a few areas where improvements were made to improve operations.
