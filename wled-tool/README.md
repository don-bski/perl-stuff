### wled-tool
**OS: Linux and Windows**<br/>
**wled-tool.pl** - This program is used to send and receive data with WLED using its json api interface. 
Available functions include backup and restore of WLED user settings (configuration, presets, custom 
palettes), an interactive preset audition function, and a preset data reformatter. The reformat function
only arranges and selectively indents the preset data to simplify text editing of a preset backup file. 
The desired function is specified using one of the program's CLI options. This tool is useful in cases 
where the normal WLED application is not available.
