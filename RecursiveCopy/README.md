### RecursiveCopy
**OS: Windows**<br/>
**recursiveCopy.pl** - This program was written to load MP3 files to an older USB SanDisk MP3 player. By 
erasing and reloading all MP3 files on the player each time, it ensures an alphabetical folder/file order 
when the SanDisk 'Folder' selection is used. As implied by the program name, the code recursively walks the 
specified staring folder. The -p option creates a playlist in each folder for files with a .mp3 extention.
