### Mp4ToMp3
**OS: Windows**<br/>
**Mp4ToMp3.pl** - This program extracts the audio track in an MP4 file and converts it to MP3 using ffmpeg. 
The audio level can be normalized. A seperate install of ffmpeg is needed if not already part of another 
windows program. Change the $FFmpeg definition in the program to point to the ffmpeg executable.
